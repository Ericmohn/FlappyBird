# FlappyBird
It is generic Flappy Bird Game developed with JS, HTML and CSS.
Was a project learned in a class and I decided to post it here.
The resolution of my Monitor is 1366x768 so I used 400px in between the Barriers if you have any other resolution I recomend 200px.
It was written with Portuguese vars and Functions.
To restart the game once you hit any barrier refresh the page.
Have Fun!!
